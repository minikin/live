  Sonic Potions SD-Card Image (alpha)
--------------------------------------
       Julian Schmidt 2013

This archive contains
- factory presets (cc-by-sa)
- global settings config file (cc-by-sa)
- firmware image (cc-by-sa-nc)

To prepare your SD card:
- Make sure your it is using a FAT32 filesystem. Otherwise the bootloader may not recognize the firmware image.
- unzip everything to your cards root folder.
- enjoy!



This is a very early version and far from finished.
